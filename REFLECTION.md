**Agent Context + Use Case**
I chose Reddit moderation combined with Gmail notifications and Google Sheets logging because managing online communities is increasingly time-consuming and critical for maintaining healthy discourse. This automation addresses a real pain point: moderators manually reviewing hundreds of comments daily, leading to burnout and inconsistent enforcement.
**AI Agent Decision-Making**
The AI Agent analyzes each comment against explicit moderation rules and classifies it into five categories: SAFE, SPAM, TOXIC, RULE_VIOLATION, or INVESTIGATE. The classification drives a binary routing decision—safe comments are passively logged to Google Sheets for record-keeping, while problematic content triggers immediate Gmail alerts to moderators with full context and recommended actions. This demonstrates how AI can serve as an intelligent triage system, filtering noise while escalating genuine concerns.
**Design and Debugging Challenges**
The primary technical challenge involved correctly configuring variable flow between Make modules. I had to add a "Set Multiple Variables" module between the Reddit trigger and AI Agent to ensure the language model received properly formatted context rather than raw JSON structures. Additionally, a "Parse JSON" module was necessary between the AI Agent and subsequent modules to convert the AI's string response into structured data that Gmail and Google Sheets could consume.
Initial testing revealed the AI misclassified a toxic comment containing profanity and personal attacks as SAFE. This highlighted the importance of explicit classification criteria and examples in AI prompts. After refining the prompt with specific toxicity rules and hostile language patterns, classification accuracy improved significantly. This demonstrates that AI agents require careful prompt engineering and testing with edge cases to perform reliably in moderation contexts.
Business Process Impact
This workflow could save moderators 10-15 hours weekly on large subreddits by automatically filtering 80-90% of benign content while ensuring problematic posts receive immediate attention. The dual-path approach balances automation efficiency with human oversight—safe content flows freely while violations are never missed. The Google Sheets logging also provides valuable analytics: moderators can track comment volume trends, identify repeat offenders, and measure community health over time.
**Future Expansion**
If expanded, I would connect Slack for real-time moderator team notifications with threaded discussions, Notion for building a knowledge base of moderation decisions and appeals, and integrate the Reddit API's removal and ban actions to close the loop from detection to enforcement. Adding a second AI Agent to analyze user comment history would enable more sophisticated pattern detection for ban evasion and coordinated harassment campaigns. Finally, sentiment analysis over time could provide early warning signals of community health deterioration.
